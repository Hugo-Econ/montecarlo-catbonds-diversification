# Monte Carlo Simulation: Cat Bonds for Risk Diversification

This project tests whether catastrophe (cat) bonds can serve as an effective diversification tool in an equity portfolio. It compares two portfolios using historical return modeling and Monte Carlo simulation:

- **100% S&P 500**
- **90% S&P 500 / 10% Cat Bonds**

---

## üî¨ Methodology

- Historical monthly returns (2006‚Äì2024) for SPY and Swiss Re Cat Bond Index were used.
- Distributions were fitted using a Student‚Äôs t-distribution (best statistical match).
- 100 Monte Carlo simulations were run, each covering a 12-month period.
- Metrics computed: annual return, volatility, Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, and Value-at-Risk (VaR).

## üìä Key Results (Average of 100 Simulations)

| Metric         | 100% S&P 500 | 90/10 Portfolio |
|----------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Final Wealth   | 117.88%      | 116.59%         |
| Annual Return  | 16.71%       | 15.57%          |
| Volatility     | 13.89%       | 12.51%          |
| Sharpe Ratio   | 122.22%      | **126.08%**     |
| Max Drawdown   | 7.38%        | **6.54%**       |
| VaR (5%)       | -4.45%       | **-3.97%**      |

## üèÜ How Often 90/10 Outperformed SPY

- Sharpe Ratio: **96%** of simulations
- VaR (5%): **99%**
- Max Drawdown: 99% had lower or equal drawdown
- Final Wealth: 28%
- Annual Return: 20%
- Volatility: 0% (SPY always more volatile)

---

## üìå Conclusion

Adding just **10% Cat Bonds**:
- Slightly reduces return (~1% p.a.)
- Significantly lowers downside risk
- Improves Sharpe ratio in nearly all scenarios

Cat Bonds offer strong potential as a **non-correlated diversifier** in equity-heavy portfolios.
